Show Events App
===============

This app is made using AngularJS (the seed project downloaded from GitHub) and it uses a Web API and Google Maps Javascript to fetch the current location. You will need your own Google API Key to use the feature - it will need to be inserted in the index.html in place of the text "<GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY>".

To run the application, use "npm start" in the command line.

The API will need to be running at the same time and it is hosted in the repository: https://github.com/DeeptiLuthra/MyMockWebApi.
